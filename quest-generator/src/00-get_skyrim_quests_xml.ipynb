      "'''Quests''' are tasks the [[Last Dragonborn|Dragonborn]] can perform in {{Skyrim}}. Various actions, such as talking to people, reading books, etc., can initiate quests, allowing for rewards to be gained by completing them. Rewards may include gold, [[Items (Skyrim)|items]], increases of [[Skills (Skyrim)|skill levels]]. Successfully completing a quest for a person makes them friendly to the Dragonborn, opening opportunities in many cases to recruit [[Follower (Skyrim)|followers]] or make [[Marriage (Skyrim)|marriage]] proposals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"main quest\" denotes tasks the Dragonborn is compelled to complete as part of the game's main story. Other quests can be performed for a guild or [[Factions (Skyrim)|faction]], while others are considered [[Side Quests (Skyrim)|side quests]], which skirt on the periphery of the game's plotlines. Not all the quests are visible in the [[Journal]]; some of them, such as selling crops or chopping wood, are hidden.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with most of {{TES}} titles, there are [[Daedric Quests (Skyrim)|quests]] for each of the [[Daedric Princes]] of [[Tamriel]], excluding [[Jyggalag]]. Unique to ''Skyrim'' are [[Radiant Quests]], quests which are initiated as part of the radiant story artificial intelligence system. These quests can be repeated an infinite number of times, allowing for never-ending gameplay. These quests can be useful for leveling up faster and/or getting gold or loot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two separate questlines were added to the game with the official [[Official Plug-ins (Skyrim)|plug-ins]], {{Dawnguard|!}} and {{Dragonborn|!}}. For coverage of these quests, see [[Quests (Dawnguard)]] and [[Quests (Dragonborn)]].\n",

The PC versions of the game allow the journal (pressing \"J\") to be accessed directly, while consoles open the journal, game settings, etc. through the same button. Quests are listed by faction and relevance to the main quest first, and alphabetically second. Thus, [[#Main quest|quests in the main quest]] appear first, but [[#Thieves Guild quests|quests involving the Thieves Guild]] appear later. [[#Miscellaneous quests|Miscellaneous quests]] are grouped together on a separate menu, accessible from the very bottom of the list of quests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most quests can be completed in any order, upon activation. However, quests markers will not appear on the world map, on the compass, or in-game unless they are marked as active in the interface. Simply selecting the affirmation button activates the quests, once it has been highlighted in the list. Completed lists are listed at the bottom of the quest menu, below a divider. The names are greyed out, and the bullets next to the objectives are filled, indicating successful completion, or marked with a red cross, indicating failure. Some quests are mutually exclusive (e.g., the Dragonborn cannot join the Imperial Legion and the Stormcloaks at the same time), so failure is not uncommon. In the menu, quests that are partially completed also have their objectives greyed out or ticked off. Optional tasks within the quest are labeled as such in the list as well.\n",
